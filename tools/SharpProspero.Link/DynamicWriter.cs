// SharpProspero.Link - a linker for module output.
// Copyright (C) 2026 SvenGDK
//
// Writes a dynamic module: an application that imports functions from other modules. It builds the
// dynamic symbol and string tables with the mangled import names, a procedure-linkage table and its
// global-offset entries, the import relocations, the dynamic table with one needed record per
// imported module, the process parameters, and the module note, and lays them out with the load,
// dynamic, and process-parameter program headers.
//
// Four load segments: executable code, read-only data, writable data, and a fourth that requests no
// memory protection and holds the dynamic-linking tables. That fourth segment is what tells the
// loader where the linking data is; a module that names a dynamic table without carrying one is
// turned away while its program headers are scanned, so it is part of the required shape rather than
// a convenience.
//
// Structure is validated against the reference module format. Loading on the device is the final step.
